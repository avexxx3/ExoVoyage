# Exo Voyage
An Android application built in accordance with the [NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/).

Exoplanet data can be complex and hard to understand, especially for students and those with limited access to educational resources. Our challenge was to simplify NASAâ€™s exoplanetary data and create an engaging, user-friendly tool that makes it easier to explore the potential for life on other planets.
Visualizes data regarding the chances of human survivability (habitability) in exoplanets, which has been calculated and charted on a seperate backend according to the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).

This is complemented by an engaging [web-based](https://exo-two.vercel.app/) interactive experience that invites users to actively explore and immerse themselves in the content.

If you end up feeling lost, you can avail the assistance of our [ExoVoyageAI](https://chatbot-3.vercel.app/) to guide you through the journey.
