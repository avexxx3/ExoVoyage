# Exo Voyage
An Android application built in accordance with its [web alternative](https://github.com/stellalphatic/ExoPlanetProject).

Visualizes data regarding the chances of human survivability (habitability) in exoplanets, which has been calculated and stored on a seperate backend according to the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).

If you end up feeling lost, you can avail the assistance of our [ExoVoyageAI](https://chatbot-3.vercel.app/) to guide you through the journey.
